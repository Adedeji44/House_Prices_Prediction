## House_Prices_Prediction - Regression Problem
### Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Decision tree regressor, Random Forest Regressor, Boosting Regressor Model, Hyperparameter Tuning

The problem at hand is to predict the housing prices of a town or a suburb based on the features of the locality provided to us. In the process, we need to identify the most important features affecting the price of the house. We need to employ techniques of data preprocessing and build a linear regression model that predicts the prices for the unseen data.

**Goal - The goal to predict the sales price for each house. For each Id in the test set, you must predict the value of the SalePrice variable.**
